**Name:** SHAZIA
**Registration Number:** TCR24CS060 
**Course:** B.Tech CSE  
**Assignment:** Implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using Baum-Welch Algorithm with Visualization  

---

## 📌 Abstract

This project implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** training system using the **Baum-Welch Algorithm (Expectation-Maximization for HMMs)** and provides an **interactive web-based visualization** of:

- State transition probabilities  
- Emission probabilities  
- Initial state distribution  
- Training convergence (log-likelihood vs iterations)  

The application visually demonstrates how HMM parameters evolve during training and helps users understand probabilistic state transitions through animations and graphs.
